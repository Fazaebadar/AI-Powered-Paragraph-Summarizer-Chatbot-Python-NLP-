# 📝 Text Summarization Chatbot

A chatbot application built in **Python** that summarizes long paragraphs into concise and coherent summaries using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## ✨ Features

* 🔹 Summarizes long text into short, meaningful content.
* 🔹 Implements **text preprocessing, tokenization, and extractive summarization algorithms**.
* 🔹 Provides **accurate and coherent summaries**.
* 🔹 Built with a **simple, interactive interface** for ease of use.
* 🔹 Useful for **students, researchers, and quick information extraction**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **NLTK / SpaCy** (for NLP preprocessing)
* **Tkinter** (for GUI)
* Other Python libraries (depending on your implementation, e.g., `re`, `string`, etc.)
